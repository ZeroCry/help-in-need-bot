### XXX

## Technical Spoilers

Just read the code, don't be lazy. Just kidding. This application was done using **NodeJS**. This are the main packages that we are using:

- Facebook API: [FB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fb).

To upload the attachments we are manually doing the **request**.

## Install

### Application

Then, comes the **easy** thing:

```bash
npm install
```

Done! Easy...

#### Start (Production)

```bash
npm start
```

#### Start (Development)

If you start the application this way, you are not going to be posting messages on Facebook

```bash
npm start-dev
```

## Deployment

This application is currently deployed on a Heroku. It has the `buildpacks` already configured.

If you want to deploy it, you just need to execute:

```bash
heroku create <NAME>
```

You can find it currently here:
